==========

Game(Game) is an implementation of ultimate Tic Tac Toe. The purpose of the project is to create a completely scale-able and modular game. The theory is that while you'll be playing ultimate tic tac toe, you could essentially play ultimate ultimate tic tac toe, or ever ultimate ultimate ultimate tic tac toe.

Rules:
  <br>1) Each turn you mark one of the smaller squares (the inner-most board).
  2) When you get three in a row on the smallest board, you've won that board.
  3) To win the game, you need to win three smaller boards in a row.
  4) The position that your opponent picks on the inner-most board, is the position that you must to on the outer-most board, on      your turn.
  5) If your opponent sends you to a square that has already been won, you may choose any square to play your next move.
  6) The player who goes first may choose any outer-board square to start the game.
